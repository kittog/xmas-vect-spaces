GLORIA EXCELSIS DEO]


Special times or events have been celebrated from time immemorial by
feasting, dancing, and singing. Often the dancers formed a ring and
sang as they danced, first the dance and later the song being called
a carol. The carol was not always strictly religious, although in the
old times both the singing and dancing often took place in cathedrals
and churches. Some of the carols that we still know are connected with
times before the Christian era. They have now lost their dance and the
melody has changed, but the ideas are very ancient. The Holly and the
Ivy suggest the old Druids, and we still put up Holly and Ivy in our
houses just as people did before the time of Christ. We put them up at
Christmas, and we sing the carol at Christmas—but the idea at the back
of it is older than Christmas, for the Church accepted all that was
found to be of value in the old customs, and adapted them to set forth
the newer faith. The carrying in of the Boar’s Head is an old ceremony,
too. It was considered a Royal Dish, and Henry II. ordered it to appear
at a special feast which he gave in honour of his son.

In the old days people thought of the New Year as the time when the
trees and flowers began to come out—that is about May Day—so the May
Day Carols celebrate the New Year’s Day of ever so long ago. Gradually,
however, carols have centred more and more round events in the life of
Christ, and especially round the wonderful story of His Birth. Many
of them have just been handed on from one person to another through
hundreds of years, some have only been written down at all during the
last century. For example, the version given here of the “Black Decree”
was sung into my phonograph by an old man of seventy-five. All the
carols chosen for this book are those which have been sung through
many, many years at times of festival and mirth (note how often food
and drink are referred to), so don’t expect them to be pious in the
modern way or to be at all like our present-day hymns.

The Publishers desire to acknowledge their indebtedness to Miss Lucy E.
Broadwood for kindly permitting them to reproduce in this collection
the following carols from her _ENGLISH TRADITIONAL SONGS AND CAROLS_:
“King Pharaoh,” “The Moon Shines Bright,” “The Sussex Mummers’ Carol,”
and “I’ve been Rambling all the Night.” Also to Miss A.G. Gilchrist for
the “Pace Egging Song” and “The Seven Joys of Mary,” and to the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould and his publishers (Messrs. Methuen & Co., Ltd.) for the
“Somersetshire Wassail” from _A GARLAND OF COUNTRY SONG_.

Good King Wenceslas

[Illustration]


    1. Good King Wenceslas looked out
      On the Feast of Stephen,
    When the snow lay round about,
      Deep and crisp and even.
    Brightly shone the moon that night,
      Though the frost was cruel,
    When a poor man came in sight,
      Gathering winter fuel.

    2. “Hither, page, and stand by me
      If thou know’st it, telling,
    Yonder peasant, who is he?
      Where and what his dwelling?”
    “Sire, he lives a good league hence
      Underneath the mountain;
    Right against the forest fence,
      By St. Agnes’ fountain.”

    3. “Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,
      Bring me pine-logs hither;
    Thou and I will see him dine,
      When we bear them thither.”
    Page and monarch forth they went,
      Forth they went together
    Through the rude wind’s wild lament
      And the bitter weather.

    4. “Sire! the night is darker now,
      And the wind blows stronger;
    Fails my heart, I know not how,
      I can go no longer.”
    “Mark my footsteps, good my page;
      Tread thou in them boldly;
    Thou shalt find the winter’s rage
      Freeze thy blood less coldly.”

    5. In his master’s steps he trod
      Where the snow lay dinted;
    Heat was in the very sod
      Which the saint had printed.
    Therefore Christian men, be sure,
      Wealth or rank possessing,
    Ye who now will bless the poor
      Shall yourselves find blessing.

As Joseph was a-walking

[Illustration]


[Music]

    1. As Joseph was a-walking
      He heard an angel sing,
    “This night shall be the birthtime
      Of Christ, the Heavenly King.

    2. “He neither shall be born
      In housen nor in hall.
    Nor in the place of Paradise,
      But in an ox’s stall.

    3. “He neither shall be clothed
      In purple nor in pall,
    But in the fair white linen
      That usen babies all.

    4. “He neither shall be rocked
      In silver nor in gold,
    But in a wooden manger
      That resteth on the mould.”

    5. As Joseph was a-walking,
      There did an angel sing;
    And Mary’s child at midnight
      Was born to be our King.

    6. Then be ye glad, good people,
      This night of all the year,
    And light ye up your candles,
      For His star it shineth clear.

Christmas Day in the Morning

    1. I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
    I saw three ships come sailing in,
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

    2. And what was in those ships all three
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
    And what was in those ships all three
    On Christmas Day in the morning?

    3. Our Saviour Christ and His lady
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
    Our Saviour Christ and His lady
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

    4. Pray whither sailed those ships all three
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
    Pray whither sailed those ships all three
    On Christmas Day in the morning?

    5. O they sailed into Bethlehem
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
    O they sailed into Bethlehem
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

    6. And all the bells on earth shall ring
    On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;

    7. And all the angels in Heaven shall sing

[Illustration]


    1. God rest you merry, Gentlemen!
      Let nothing you dismay;
    Remember Christ our Saviour
      Was born upon this day,
    To save us all from Satan’s power
      When we were gone astray.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    2. In Bethlehem in Jury
      This blessèd Babe was born,
    And laid within a manger
      Upon this blessèd morn:
    The which His Mother Mary
      Nothing did take in scorn.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    3. From God, our Heavenly Father,
      A blessèd angel came,
    And unto certain shepherds
      Brought tidings of the same,
    How that in Bethlehem was born
      The Son of God by name.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    4. “Fear not,” then said the angel,
      “Let nothing you affright:
    This day is born a Saviour
      Of virtue, power, and might;
    So frequently to vanquish all
      The friends of Satan quite.”
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    5. The shepherds at those tidings
      Rejoiced much in mind,
    And left their flocks a-feeding
      In tempest, storm, and wind,
    And went to Bethlehem straightway
      This blessèd Babe to find.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    6. But when to Bethlehem they came,
      Where this dear Infant lay,
    They found Him in a manger
      Where oxen feed on hay;
    His mother Mary, kneeling,
      Unto the Lord did pray.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

    7. Now to the Lord sing praises,
      All you within this place,
    And with true love and brotherhood
      Each other now embrace;
    This holy-tide of Christmas
     All others doth efface.
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
    O tidings of comfort and joy.

The Holy Well

[Illustration]


    1.  As it fell out one May morning,
    On a bright holiday,
    Sweet Jesus ask’d His mother dear,
    If He might go to play.
        “To play, to play, sweet Jesus go.
    And to play now get you gone,
    And let me hear of no complaints,
    At night when you come home.”

    2.  Sweet Jesus went down to yonder town,
    As far as the Holy Well,
    And there did see as fine children
    As any tongue can tell.
        He said, “God bless you ev’ry one,
    May Christ your portion be:
    Little children, shall I play with you?
    And you shall play with Me.”

    3.  But they made answer to Him, “No,”
    They were lords’ and ladies’ sons;
    And He the meanest of them all,
    Was born in an ox’s stall.
        Sweet Jesus turned Him around,
    And He neither laugh’d nor smil’d,
    But the tears came trickling from His eyes
    Like water from the skies.

    4.  Sweet Jesus turned Him about,
    To His mother’s dear home went He,
    And said “I’ve been in yonder town,
    As after you may see.
        I’ve been in yonder town,
    As far as the Holy Well;
    There did I meet as fine children
    As any tongue can tell.

    5.  I bid God bless them ev’ry one,
    And Christ their bodies see;
    Little children, shall I play with you?
    And you shall play with Me.
        But then they answer’d Me ‘No,’
    They were lords’ and ladies’ sons;
    And I the meanest of them all,
    Was born in an ox’s stall.”

    6.  “Though you are but a maiden’s child,
    Born in an ox’s stall,
    Thou art the Christ, the King of Heav’n,
    And the Saviour of them all.
        Sweet Jesus, go down to yonder town,
    As far as the Holy Well,
    And take away those sinful souls,
    And dip them deep in hell.”

    7.  “Nay, nay,” sweet Jesus mildly said,
    “Nay, nay, that must not be;
    For there are too many sinful souls
    Crying out for the help of Me.”
        O then bespoke the angel Gabriel,
    “Upon our good St. Stephen,
    Although you’re but a maiden’s Child,
    You are the King of Heav’n.”

The First Nowell

[Illustration]


[Music]

    1. The first Nowell the Angel did say
    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
    In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
    On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.
      CHORUS.
        Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell!
        Born is the King of Israel!

    2. They looked up and saw a Star
    Shining in the east beyond them far,
    And to the earth it gave great light,
    And so it continued both day and night.
        Nowell, etc.

    3. And by the light of that same Star
    Three wise men came from country far;
    To seek for a king was their intent,
    And to follow the Star wherever it went.
        Nowell, etc.

    4. This Star drew nigh to the north-west
    O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right o’er the place where Jesus lay.
        Nowell, etc.

    5. Then entered in those wise men three
    Most reverently upon their knee,
    And offered there, in His presence,
    Both gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
        Nowell, etc.

    6. Then let us all with one accord
    Sing praises to our Heavenly Lord,
    That hath made Heaven and earth of nought,
    And with His blood mankind hath bought.
        Nowell, etc.

The Cherry Tree Carol

[Illustration]


[Music]

    1. Joseph was an old man,
    An old man was he;
    He married sweet Mary,
    The Queen of Galilee.

    2. As they went a-walking
    In the garden so gay,
    Sweet Mary spied cherries
    Hanging over yon tree.

    3. Mary said to Joseph,
    With her sweet lips so mild,
    “Pluck those cherries, Joseph,
    For to give to my child.”

    4. “O then,” replied Joseph,
    With words so unkind,
    “I will pluck no cherries
    For to give to thy child.”

    5. Mary said to cherry tree
    “Bow down to my knee,
    That I may pluck cherries,
    By one, two, and three.”

    6. The uppermost sprig then
    Bowed down to her knee,
    “Thus you may see, Joseph,
    These cherries are for me.”

    7. “O eat your cherries, Mary,
    O eat your cherries now,
    O eat your cherries, Mary,
    That grow upon the bough.”

Dives and Lazarus

[Illustration]


[Music]

    1. As it fell out upon a day,
      Rich Dives made a feast,
    And he invited all his friends,
      And gentry of the best.

    2. Then Lazarus laid him down and down,
      And down at Dives’s door.
    “Some meat, some drink, brother Dives,
      Bestow upon the poor.”

    3. “Thou’rt none of mine, brother Lazarus,
      That lies begging at my door:
    Nor meat nor drink will I give to thee,
      Nor bestow upon the poor.”

    4. Then Dives sent out his hungry dogs,
      To bite him as he lay;
    They had no power to bite at all,
      But licked his sores away.

    5. As it fell out upon a day,
      Poor Lazarus sickened and died,
    There came two Angels out of Heaven
      His soul therein to guide.

    6. As it fell out upon a day,
      Rich Dives sickened and died,
    There came two serpents out of Hell,
      His soul therein to guide.

    7. Then Dives looked with burning eyes,
      And saw poor Lazarus blest;
    “One drop of water, Lazarus,
      To quench my flaming thirst!

    8. “Oh! had I as many years to abide
      As there are blades of grass.
    Then there would be an end; but now
      Hell’s pains will never pass.”

    1. The Holly and the Ivy
      Now both are full well grown;
    Of all the trees that spring in wood
      The Holly bears the crown;
    The Holly bears a blossom
      As white as lily flower,
    And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
      To be our sweet Saviour,
    To be our sweet Saviour.

    2. The Holly bears a berry
      As red as any blood;
    And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
      To do poor sinners good.
    The Holly bears a prickle
      As sharp as any thorn;
    And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
      On Christmas day in the morn,
    On Christmas day in the morn.

    3. The Holly bears a bark
      As bitter as any gall;
    And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
      For to redeem us all.
    The Holly and the Ivy

A Virgin Most Pure

[Illustration]


    1.

    A virgin most pure, as the Prophet foretold,
    Should bring forth a Saviour, which now we behold.
    To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,
    Which Adam’s transgression had wrappèd us in.
      Rejoice and be merry, cast sorrow aside,
      Christ Jesus, our Saviour, was born on this tide.

    2.

    In Bethlehem city, in Jury it was
    When Joseph and Mary together did pass
    All for to be taxed with many one more,
    For Cæsar commanded the same should be so.
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

    3.

    But when they had entered the city so far,
    A number of people so mighty was there
    That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,
    Could get in the city no lodging at all.
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

    4.

    Then they were constrained in a stable to lie,
    Where oxen and asses they used to tie;
    Their lodging so simple they held it no scorn,
    But against the next morning our Saviour was born.
      Rejoice and be merry, set sorrow aside,
      Christ Jesus, our Saviour, was born on this tide.

    5.

    The King of all Glory to the world being brought,
    Small store of fine linen to wrap Him was bought;
    When Mary had swaddled her young Son so sweet,
    Within an ox-manger she laid Him to sleep.
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

    6.

    Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high
    To certain poor shepherds in fields as they lie,
    And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay
    Because that our Saviour was born on this day.
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

    7.

    Then presently after, the shepherds did spy
    A number of angels appear in the sky,
    Who joyfully talked and sweetly did sing
    “To God be all glory, our Heavenly King.”
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

    8.

    Three certain wise princes, they thought it most meet
    To lay their rich offerings at our Saviour’s feet;
    Then the shepherds consented, and to Bethlehem did go
    And when they came thither, they found it was so.
      Rejoice and be merry, etc.

      Oh, where did you then pass?”
    “It is out of the Land of Egypt,
      Between an ox and ass.”

      One thing I deem thou know’st:
    Is Jesus born of Mary
      And of the Holy Ghost?

    4. “And if the news be true, good man,
      That you are telling me,
    Make this roasted cock to crow three times
      In the dish which here we see.”

A SHROPSHIRE VERSION.


    1.

    Let Christians all with one accord rejoice
    And praises sing with heart as well as voice,
    To God on high, for wonders He hath done
    In sending us His well belovèd Son.

    2.

    The night before that happy day of grace
    The Virgin Mother, she had no resting place;
    She and her pious Joseph were so low
    They scarcely knew which way or where to go.

    3.

    For they were forced to wander up and down
    And they could find no lodging in the town;
    But in an ox’s stall where beasts are fed
    His mother made our Lord His lowly bed.

    4.

    Three wise men by a star were thither brought
    And found the blessèd Babe they long had sought.
    The best of spices and rich costly things
    They humbly offered unto the King of kings.

    5.

    Then rather than the Lord of life betray
    They worshipped Him and went another way,
    Which so enraged the wicked Herod then
    (The Jewish king, the very worst of men);

    6.

    He caused young harmless infants to be killed;
    All under two years old, their blood was spilled.
    Dear parents’ tears could not his rage prevent,
    Nor pity move the tyrant to repent.

    7.

    The Black Decree went all the country round,
    To kill and murder children both sick and sound;
    They tore young infants from their mothers’ breast,
    Thinking to murder Christ among the rest.

    8.

    But God above, Who knew what would be done,
    Had sent to Egypt His Belovèd Son:
    Where with His earthly parents He was fed
    Until that cruel tyrant he was dead.

    And now I must no longer stay,
      And say no word but mum.
    For I perforce must take my leave
      Of all my dainty cheer—
    Plum porridge, roast beef, and minc’d pies,
      My strong ale and my beer.

    2. Kind hearted Christmas, now adieu,
      For I with thee must part;
    But oh! to take my leave of thee
      Doth grieve me at the heart.
    Thou wert an ancient housekeeper,
      And mirth with meat didst keep,
    But thou art going out of town
      Which causes me to weep.

    3. Come, butler, fill a brimmer full,
      To cheer my fainting heart,
    That to old Christmas I may drink
      Before he does depart.
    And let each one that’s in the room
      With me likewise condole,
    And now to cheer their spirits sad
      Let each one drink a bowl.

    4. And when the same it hath gone round,
      Then fall unto your cheer;
    For you well know that Christmas time
      It comes but once a year.
    Thanks to my master and my dame
      That do such cheer afford,
    God bless them, that each Christmas they
      May furnish so their board.

A CAROL FOR CHRISTMAS EVE.

    1.

    The Lord at first did Adam make
      Out of the dust and clay,
    And in his nostrils breathèd life,
      E’en as the Scriptures say.
    And then in Eden’s Paradise
      He placèd him to dwell,
    That he within it should remain,
      To dress and keep it well.
          Now let good Christians all begin
            A holy life to live,
          And to rejoice and merry be,
            For this is Christmas Eve.

    2.

    And thus within the garden he
      Commanded was to stay;
    And unto him in commandment
      These words the Lord did say,
    “The fruit that in the garden grows
      To thee shall be for meat,
    Except the tree in midst thereof,
      Of which thou shalt not eat.”
          Now let good Christians, etc.

    3.

    “For in that day thou dost it touch,
      Or dost it then come nigh,
    And if that thou dost eat thereof,
      Then thou shalt surely die.”
    But Adam he did take no heed
      To that same holy thing,
    But did transgress God’s holy laws,
      And sore was wrapp’d in sin.
          Now let good Christians all begin
            A holy life to live,
          And to rejoice and merry be,
            For this is Christmas Eve.

    4.

    Now mark the goodness of the Lord,
      Which He to mankind bore;
    His mercy soon He did extend
      Lost man for to restore;
    And then, for to redeem our souls
      From death, and hell, and thrall,
    He said His own dear Son should come
      The Saviour of us all.
          Now let good Christians, etc.

    5.

    And now the tide is nigh at hand
      In which our Saviour came,
    Let us rejoice and merry be
      In keeping of the same.
    Let’s feed the poor and hungry sort,
      And such as do it crave;
    And when we die, in Heaven be sure
      Our reward we shall have.
          Now let good Christians, etc.

    As I sat on a sunny bank,
    A sunny bank, a sunny bank;
    As I sat on a sunny bank,
    On Christmas Day in the morning,

    2.

    I spied three ships come sailing by,
    Come sailing by, come sailing by,
    I spied three ships come sailing by,
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

    3.

    And who should be with these three ships,
    With these three ships, with these three ships,
    And who should be with these three ships,
    But Joseph and his fair lady.

    4.

    Oh, he did whistle and she did sing,
    And all the bells on earth did ring
    For joy, that our Saviour He was born
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

Pace-Egging[A] Song

[Illustration]


[Music: AN EASTER CAROL, AS SUNG FORMERLY ABOUT MIDDLETON, WESTMORLAND.]

    1.

    Oh, here come we jolly boys, all of one mind,
    We’ve come a-pace-egging, I hope you’ll prove kind.
    I hope you’ll prove kind with your eggs and good cheer;
    We’ll no more come nigh you until the next year.
        Fol de diddle dum,
        Fol de day!
        Fol de diddle di dum day!

    2.

    The first that comes in is Lord Nelson, you see,
    He’s a valiant old laddie in every degree;
    He’s a valiant old lad, and he wears a pigtail,
    And all his delight is in drinking mulled ale.
        Fol de diddle dum, etc.

    3.

    The next that comes in is a jolly Jack Tar,
    He sailed with Lord Nelson a-during last war;
    He’s arrived from the sea old England to view,
    And he’s come the pace-egging with us jolly crew.
        Fol de diddle dum, etc.

    4.

    The next that comes in is a soldier, you see,
    He’s a bunch of blue ribbons right down to his knee,
    He’s a star on his breast like silver does shine,
    I hope you’ll remember it’s pace-egging time.
        Fol de diddle dum, etc.

    5.

    The last that comes in is old Nan with her bags,
    For sake of her money she wears but old rags;
    She’s gold and she’s silver and money in store,
    She’s come along with us in hopes to get more.
        Fol de diddle dum, etc.

    6.

    Ladies and gentlemen that sit by the fire,
    Put your hand in your pocket, that’s all our desire;
    Put your hand in your pocket and pull out your purse,
    And give us a trifle, you’ll not be much worse.
        Fol de diddle dum, etc.

I’ve been Rambling all the Night

[Music: BEDFORDSHIRE MAY DAY CAROL.]

    1.

    I’ve been rambling all the night,
    And the best part of the day,
    And now I am returning back again,
    And have brought you a branch of may.

    2.

    A branch of may, my dear, I say,
    Before your door I stand;
    It’s nothing but a sprout, but it’s well budded out
    By the work of our Lord’s hand.

    3.

    Go down in your dairy, and fetch me a cup,
    A cup of your good cheer,
    And, if I should live to tarry in the town,
    I will call on you next year.

    4.

    The hedges and the fields they are so green,
    As green as any leaf,
    Our Heavenly Father waters them
    With His Heavenly dew so sweet.

    5.

    When I am dead and in my grave,
    And covered with cold clay,
    The nightingale will sit and sing
    And pass the time away.

    6.

    Take a Bible in your hand
    And read a chapter through
    And when the day of Judgment comes,
    The Lord will think of you.

    7.

    I have a bag on my right arm
    Draws up with a silken string,
    Nothing does it want but a silver piece
    To line it well within.

    8.

    And now my song is almost done,
    I can no longer stay,
    God bless you all, both great and small,
    I wish you a joyful May.
